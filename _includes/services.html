                <strong>Electricity</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>Using the intelligence gathered from consumption data, 
                electric utilities can increase operational efficiency, 
                predict loads and outages and be prepared for various 
                situations by performing what-if analysis.</p>
                <p>
                  For over a century, coal and other fossil fuels have been used by power plants to produce the electricity we use everyday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As technology transforms the electric grid, the rapidly emerging microgrids, intelligent sensors, 
                  2-way communication, digitization, and automation of energy management processes have laid the 
                  foundation to not only smart grids but also smart energy.

                <strong>Water</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>Water consumption data helps cities to better manage their water resources. 
                The leaks in the grid can be identified and fixed faster with smart grids. 
                For example, France has identified and repaired 1,200 water leaks, 
                achieved an eight percent increase in water network efficiency, and saved 
                over one million cubic meters of water due to the distribution networkâ€™s 
                improved performance by utilizing water consumption data.</p>
                <p>
                  For a number of factors ranging from the growth of the world population to global warming and potential 
                  extinction of lakes and seas, water is increasingly becoming more valuable and receiving the attention it deserves.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Not only a source of comfort in homes and productivity for businesses, 
                natural gas has also become a vital fuel source for electric generation throughout the world.
              </p>
              <p>Natural gas is a valuable commodity and a driving force for global economy. Efficient, 
                clean and intelligent technologies are required to better 
                manage the natural gas production and consumption. As is the case with electricity and water, 
                natural gas consumption data provides the intelligence needed to increase the efficiency of 
                our grids and make sustainable use of this precious, finite resource for future generations.</p>
