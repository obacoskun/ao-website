For over a century, coal and other fossil fuels have been used by power plants to produce the electricity we use everyday.

As technology transforms the electric grid, the rapidly emerging microgrids, intelligent sensors, 2-way communication, digitization, and automation of energy management processes have laid the foundation to not only smart grids but also smart energ.

Using the intelligence gathered from consumption data, electric utilities can increase operational efficiency, predict loads and outages and be prepared for various situations by performing what-if analysis.
